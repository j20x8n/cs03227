Educational Aims of the ModuleThe aim of this dissertation module is to enable students to   undertake a significant   piece   of   independent   research   on   a   particular topic   in   business   and   management field.       This   module   provides   students with   opportunities to: (i) apply their learning to analyse contemporary and ‘cutting edge’   problems   and   issues   of   relevance   to   scholars   or   practitioners   or   both;   (ii)   deepen   their   knowledge   and   understanding   of   a   particular topic of interest to   them; (iii) produce a complete piece of scholarly work or a project of practical   value from conception through to a final thesis or report; (iv) further their independent research skills, i.e.   data   management,   project   management,   writing   and   presenting   findings;   (v)   enhance   their   intellectual   and   employability   skills   and   their   career   prospects,   and   (iv)   make   an   original   contribution   with   either   theoretical or practical value.Students should identify, define and explore one or more   problems   or   issues   at   the forefront   of   business   and   management   as   an   academic   discipline.   This   may   lead   to   a   large   piece   of   independent   writing   in   one of the following   styles:
•          Standard academic   research   based dissertation,
•          Company   based   project on   a   particular   issue,
•          Business   plan   including sections   of literature   review   and   methodology.The dissertation should demonstrate:   (i) an analytical and   critical   approach   to   problem   definition;   (ii)   the   derivation of appropriate research questions and/or hypotheses; (iii) skills in designing and implementing   a   suitable   methodology for   gathering,   analysing   and   interpreting   data   and   information that   address the   research   problem,   questions   and/or   hypotheses;   (iv)   knowledge   and   understanding   of   literature   and   theories relevant to the area of inquiry, and the ability   to   apply   it   appropriately,   and   (v)   the   ability   to write   up   and    present   the    research   as   a   dissertation   in   a   way   that   combines   academic   depth   and   good   scholarship with an appreciation of relevant practical and policy issues as appropriate in relevant subject   areas.

Methods of Learning and TeachingAs   MSc   dissertation   is   an   independent   research   students   are   required to   do,   students   are   expected   to   independently   manage the time   and workload with the   support   of their   dissertation   supervisor.   Support   to research methodology and method training   has   been   provided through   semester   1   and   2.
Typically, the dissertation work starts in semester 2 when students should firstly identify their dissertation   focus. Students can select a research focus   in one   of the following ways:
1. Select a topic   proposed   by   IBSS faculties and seek agreement with the   faculty   member.
2. Self-select a topic and approach the faculty who   has similar   research   interest   and   seek   agreement.Students   are   expected   to   work   on   their   confirmed   dissertation   plan   once   their   supervisor   approves   it.   The   role   of dissertation   supervisor   is to support   students   during their   dissertation   project   time   once   the   supervision   is confirmed. Such a support ends with the   submission   of the final   dissertation.   Supervisors   are expected to   meet with their students and support   in   key aspects   of the   dissertation   project   including   topic selection,   literature review, research methodology, data   analysis   and findings.
Syllabus  Teaching Plan
On supporting students’ dissertation work, supervisors should consider to give advices and   suggestions   to the following areas:
•             Research topic selection.   Students   should   propose   more   narrowly focused topics   for   discussion.
•             Review    of    relevant   literature.   Supervisor   suggests   some   readings   or   some   literature   searching   techniques and students are expected to find and summarize   relevant   readings.
•             Design of methodology. This is a key area   where supervisor should provide more support to   ensure   that students can   better understand how to   prepare and   carry   out   data   collection.
•             Data   management   and   development   of conclusions.
